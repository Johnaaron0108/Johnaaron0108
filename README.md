<h2>🚀 Featured Projects</h2>

### 🔍 Helmet Detection
A deep learning model to detect helmets in images using CNNs and bounding boxes.

[🔗 View Project](https://github.com/Johnaaron0108/CNN_Helmet_Pred)

###  Time_Ser_LSTM  
A deep learning project that leverages **LSTM networks** to predict future weather parameters using historical time-series data.  
## 📌 Features  
- Preprocessed meteorological datasets for time-series modeling  
- Implemented an **LSTM-based model** using TensorFlow  
- Evaluated model accuracy with **RMSE** and **MAE** metrics  
- Utilized **Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn** for preprocessing and evaluation
  
🚀 Rocket_launchin_assist_AGENT

An AI-powered agent that integrates historical and real-time weather data via APIs, combining rule-based analysis with an LLM-driven natural language interface to evaluate weather conditions and provide safe rocket launch recommendations.
📌 Features
Fetches real-time weather data using OpenWeatherMap API
Integrates historical datasets for context-aware analysis
Combines rule-based safety checks with LLM reasoning
Natural language interface for interactive queries and launch advisories
Uses FAISS + SentenceTransformers for efficient semantic search over historical conditions

💬 Chatbot with NLP and Deep Learning  
A context-aware chatbot built using NLTK and a deep neural network. It classifies user intents using tokenization, lemmatization, and a bag-of-words model, and responds intelligently based on trained intents.
